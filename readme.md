Guide to building a personal treadmill for low intensity steady state exercise

# The value of exercise and LISS
The field of exercise and body modification is politicized across multiple axes. 
Behavioural interventions are highly multifactorial and can be individual.

This makes this topic rather murky.

The potential value of LISS are:

* Exercise promoting additional break down of fat. It is worth noting that during the course of a day an individual will release and reabsorb a reasonable amount of fat from adipose tissue, however this amount is limited and varies depending on adiposisity, and for individuals interested in low body fat levels LISS can allow more fat breakdown.
* Preferential fat utilization as compared to higher intensity forms of exercise. This will be irrelevant for many daily activity structures, but becomes relevant with large amounts of exercise or when small numbers of calories are consumed.
* Lower impact exercise 

A common refrain is that "you can't out exercise a bad diet" it is of course to be noted that if one is trying to cause the breakdown of fatty tissue one approach is modify diet.
However, it is equally to be noted that this topic is politiced to the degree that people will have a desire to attribute any excess weight to "gluttony" for multiple reasons.
This non-scientific behaviour unfortunately extends into the public communication of health organizations and health practictioners themselves. It is a shameful but unfortunate truth about organizations like the NHS. The individual must make their own decisions on this matter.

Some drawbacks of LISS

* Time limitations that can interfere with other aspects of the individuals life
* Can be relatively boring compared to other exercises
* If motion is used in LISS, this motion can take you away from a single location that can be logistically complicated

# Principles

When bored do something else.

# Assumptions of the lissinator
1. Some use of money and "tinkering" in order to help build habits

Things that might need to be true about someone using the LISSinator approach

1. Likes tweaking
2. Has a reasonable amount of time (this perhaps does not work well for those with young children)
3. Perhaps does not suit those who are highly competitive or social well.

# When this approach could work well
Work from home could help with the implementation of this task.

# Treadmill
I use the proform trainer 8.0. The sole characteristic for this treadmill was that it had a 10% incline and was less expensive than other treadmills.  It is produced by nordictrack - who unfortunately do not have open standards for extracting data from bluetooth. However, this has been reverse engineered by the qdomyous-zwift open source app. I bought this treadmill with a full expectation that I would have to install a zwift runn device for tracking (which my research suggested was a better strategy).

If money.. and the need to move was no issue I would have bought a nordictrack device with a 40% angle.

# Tracking treadmill use
qdomyous-zwift can be set up to sync data to strava - an app to track cycling and running - which can be used for free. I then sync strava data to google sheets us the api for long term review and daily review.

Tracking weight training

I do a little weight training on the lissinator.  You could probably use a proper app for this. But as discussed in the motivations - messing with my phone is something I want to avoid doing. For this purposes I plan to use a task action combined with a keyboard mapper input. 

# Things to do on the LISSinator
Such choices are likely highly personal, and it may be a bad idea to do exactly as I do. There may however be some constraints on things that are interesting. 

## Consumption and performance
On my LISSinator I have both musical instruments and drama television.

# Using a computer

I am using a mac computer both as a virtual guitar pedal and to learn language

I had originally 

## Remote control for mac
See [mac remote](mac-remote/readme.md) for this.

Using a treadmill means that it is often difficult to type. A solution
we propose here is using a handheld keyboard as a remote control. The idea is that the handheld keyboard can be held while doing the treadmill allowing for freer motion.

I originally used a "Rii New Dual Mode Wireless Multimedia Keyboard with Touchpad Mouse I4" with a mac. But later moved on to the older Rii X8 wireless keyboard without bluetooh since I had one spare and wanted to use the bluetooth keyboard for an android device. 

## Switching desktops
We use hammerspoon together with a the bluetooth keyboard and a binding for this in karabiner. 

# Language learning
I use Language Reactor to do this, together with netflix (or youtube) this allows you to consume content with notes.

## Learning sheet music
[Main page](https://github.com/talwrii/learn-sight-reading-through-improv-and-musescore)

I tried using muse score to learn music by creating it as a played. However muse scores had some issues with the reliability of midi input so I am trialing Sibelius.

Muse score has a large a large library of sheet music.

# Screens
I found that I often wanted to both consume content to learn a language while also interacting with sheet music or taking notes and did not want to "lose my place" in the media I was consuming. For this purpose I bought a second "portable screen". These are relatively inexpensive and the form of the screen is similar to a laptop - allowing the screen to be kept on the LISSinators mdf headboard.

As part of the remote control. I had some bindings to switch a desktop on one screen and one on another.
