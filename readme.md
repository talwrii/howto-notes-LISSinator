# The value of exercise and LISS
The field of exercise and body modification is politicized across multiple axes. 
Behavioural interventions are highly multifactorial and can be individual.

This makes this topic rather murky.

The potential value of LISS are:

* Exercise promoting additional break down of fat. It is worth noting that during the course of a day an individual will release and reabsorb a reasonable amount of fat from adipose tissue, however this amount is limited and varies depending on adiposisity, and for individuals interested in low body fat levels LISS can allow more fat breakdown.
* Preferential fat utilization as compared to higher intensity forms of exercise. This will be irrelevant for many daily activity structures, but becomes relevant with large amounts of exercise or when small numbers of calories are consumed.
* Lower impact exercise 

A common refrain is that "you can't out exercise a bad diet" it is of course to be noted that if one is trying to cause the breakdown of fatty tissue one approach is modify diet.
However, it is equally to be noted that this topic is politiced to the degree that people will have a desire to attribute any excess weight to "gluttony" for multiple reasons.
This non-scientific behaviour unfortunately extends into the public communication of health organizations and health practictioners themselves. It is a shameful but unfortunate truth about organizations like the NHS. The individual must make their own decisions on this matter.

Some drawbacks of LISS

* Time limitations that can interfere with other aspects of the individuals life
* Can be relatively boring compared to other exercises
* If motion is used in LISS, this motion can take you away from a single location that can be logistically complicated
