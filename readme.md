Guide to building a personal treadmill for low intensity steady state exercise

# The value of exercise and LISS
The field of exercise and body modification is politicized across multiple axes. 
Behavioural interventions are highly multifactorial and can be individual.

This makes this topic rather murky.

The potential value of LISS are:

* Exercise promoting additional break down of fat. It is worth noting that during the course of a day an individual will release and reabsorb a reasonable amount of fat from adipose tissue, however this amount is limited and varies depending on adiposisity, and for individuals interested in low body fat levels LISS can allow more fat breakdown.
* Preferential fat utilization as compared to higher intensity forms of exercise. This will be irrelevant for many daily activity structures, but becomes relevant with large amounts of exercise or when small numbers of calories are consumed.
* Lower impact exercise 

A common refrain is that "you can't out exercise a bad diet" it is of course to be noted that if one is trying to cause the breakdown of fatty tissue one approach is modify diet.
However, it is equally to be noted that this topic is politiced to the degree that people will have a desire to attribute any excess weight to "gluttony" for multiple reasons.
This non-scientific behaviour unfortunately extends into the public communication of health organizations and health practictioners themselves. It is a shameful but unfortunate truth about organizations like the NHS. The individual must make their own decisions on this matter.

Some drawbacks of LISS

* Time limitations that can interfere with other aspects of the individuals life
* Can be relatively boring compared to other exercises
* If motion is used in LISS, this motion can take you away from a single location that can be logistically complicated


# Assumptions of the lissinator
1. Some use of money and "tinkering" in order to help build habits

Things that might need to be true about someone using the LISSinator approach

1. Likes tweaking
2. Has a reasonable amount of time (this perhaps does not work well for those with young children)
3. Perhaps does not suit those who are highly competitive or social well.

# When this approach could work well
Work from home could help with the implementation of this task.


# Treadmill
I use the proform trainer 8.0. The sole characteristic for this treadmill was that it had a 10% incline and was less expensive than other treadmills.  It is produced by nordictrack - who unfortunately do not have open standards for extracting data from bluetooth. However, this has been reverse engineered by the qdomyous-zwift open source app. I bought this treadmill with a full expectation that I would have to install a zwift runn device for tracking (which my research suggested was a better strategy).

If money.. and the need to move was no issue I would have bought a nordictrack device with a 40% angle.

# Tracking treadmill use
qdomyous-zwift can be set up to sync data to strava - an app to track cycling and running - which can be used for free. I then sync strava data to google sheets us the api for long term review and daily review.

# Things to do on the LISSinator

Such choices are likely highly personal, and it may be a bad idea to do exactly as I do. There may however be some constraints on things that are interesting. 

## Consumption and performance
On my LISSinator I have both musical instruments and drama television.




#Remote control for mac
Using a treadmill means that it is often difficult to type. A solution
we propose here is using a handheld keyboard as a remote control.

## Switching desktops
We use hammerspoon for this
